# What would confuse the reader?

Read the text with an eye for what might confuse a reader who comes from an adjacent field, or where the argument relies on assumptions that may not be shared by all readers. Flag any passages that might be confusing, and suggest rewrites that clarify the meaning, or provide necessary background,.

# Remove redundancy and rhetoric

Find and remove redundant sentences — sentences that repeat a point already made, add no new information, or can be cut without losing meaning. Do not rewrite sentences; simply delete the redundant ones. Preserve markdown formatting, headers, and footnotes exactly.

You can also remove examples that are redundant with other examples, or that do not add new information.

Finally, find rhetorical flourishes — emotional appeals disguised as reasoning, unbacked claims, sensationalism, or dramatic language that substitutes for argument. Replace each with a substantive, clear statement. If the rhetorical sentence has no substantive replacement, delete it.

In these tasks, it's helpful to keep in mind the field's standards for evidence and argumentation, and to ask whether each sentence meets those standards. If not, it may be a candidate for removal or revision. Sometimes you'll get an acacdemic paper, sometimes you'll get a blog post, but even blog posts for a given field should meet the field's standards for evidence and argumentation.

# Hedge too-strong claimss

Find claims that are stated too strongly — assertions without sufficient evidence, universal claims that should be qualified, or confident predictions that should be hedged. Rewrite only the over-strong sentences to add appropriate hedging (e.g., "tends to", "in many cases", "I suspect", "one possibility is"). Do not change anything else.

# Bad or boring rhythm

Find passages where the rhythm of the writing is bad or boring — sentences that are all the same length, or that follow the same structure, or that have a monotonous cadence. Suggest rewrites that vary sentence length and structure, and that add some energy and interest to the writing. This can be as simple as breaking up long sentences, or combining short sentences, or adding some rhetorical devices like parallelism, repetition, or contrast.
