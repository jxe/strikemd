# Remove redundant sentences

Find and remove redundant sentences — sentences that repeat a point already made, add no new information, or can be cut without losing meaning. Do not rewrite sentences; simply delete the redundant ones. Preserve all markdown formatting, headers, math blocks, and footnotes exactly.

# Hedge too-strong claims

Find claims that are stated too strongly — assertions without sufficient evidence, universal claims that should be qualified, or confident predictions that should be hedged. Rewrite only the over-strong sentences to add appropriate hedging (e.g., "tends to", "in many cases", "I suspect", "one possibility is"). Do not change anything else.

# Replace rhetoric with substance

Find rhetorical flourishes — emotional appeals disguised as reasoning, unbacked claims, sensationalism, or dramatic language that substitutes for argument. Replace each instance with a substantive, clear statement. If the rhetorical sentence has no substantive replacement, delete it.

# Activate passive voice

Find instances of passive voice and rewrite them in active voice where it improves clarity and directness. Leave passive voice in place when it is genuinely better (e.g., when the actor is unknown or unimportant).

# Clarify unclear sentences

Find sentences that are unclear, ambiguous, or hard to parse on first reading. Rewrite them for clarity — shorter sentences, more direct structure, concrete language. Do not change the meaning.

# Make the download explicit

Find passages where the author explains ideas abstractly without giving the reader a concrete framework, model, or tool they can use. Suggest rewrites that make the download explicit — name the framework, tease the payoff, tell the reader what they'll be able to do. Also flag passages that lecture ("here's why this is important") and rewrite them in the energy of "you're about to be able to do something you couldn't do before."
