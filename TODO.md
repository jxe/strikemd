# Today

- Streaming / progress feedback — Right now you stare at a spinner until the whole response comes back. The block-based format makes this natural: stream the response, show "Reviewing block 12/47..." as each line arrives. Especially with extended thinking, the wait can feel long.

# Soonish

- Undo — There's no way to un-accept or un-reject a suggestion. One misclick and you're stuck. A simple undo stack on the frontend would help.
- Some checks always should run in Opus

# Later
- Let's make the thing on the left an editor
- ability to run a check in the background while you're finishing the previous one
- A kind of "store" for checks, maybe a github repo where people make pull requests to add checks, and you can add them to your local .strikemd/checks.md file
